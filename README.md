 The task is to classify data as musk or non-musk. I have used LSTM as a deep learning model. the data is a liitle imbalanced as the data belonging to class 0 is more han 5 times belonging to class 1, hence some data is randomly selected from class 0. The data has is split in  80:20 ratio for training and validation.
